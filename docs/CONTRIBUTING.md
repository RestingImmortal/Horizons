# Contributing to Horizons

If you're unsure about something, it doesn't hurt to open an issue.

## Opening a PR

When submitting to the repository, all commits must be signed-off.

This can be done through `git commit -s` when you commit, or using the appropriate checkbox in your IDE or tooling of choice.
By signing, you show you have read, understand, and are in accordance with the [DCO](DCO.txt).
I feel this is an important step for ensuring legal protection for both myself and others who may use the engine from possible legal troubles.
